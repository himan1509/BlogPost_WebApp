# BlogPost_WebApp
Hello,
This is a small WebApp which is based on Python-Flask
This is a Blog POsting website that runs on LocalHost created by Me on purpose of learning Python-Flask. It contain some cool features which can be a good for small project.
I have used visual studio code for making and running this application so if anyone using this I would recommend to use the same.
To run this what you need to do is (After Cloning the repo) :-
1. Open Visual Studo Code (or any other application you would like to use)
2. Go to directory in the application.
3. Now as you would have seen I have created a virtual environment so run that for running that in VS Code type 'source envTest/bin/activate'
4. Now as Virtual Environment is running you should check few things:-
  a. Flask is installed (check using flask --version)
  b. Python-SQLAlchemy is installed 
5. After that just run the code but not directly. If working on VS Code then go to run and debug and then run the code using Flask and it will automatically start operating on 127.0.0.1:5000
6. If working on another application use python app.py to start its working on Flask server


Hope you like the application, it is basic but I have tried to cover most of the things in it.
